# Inventory-Optimization

An academic study about the policies and techniques involved in inventory management. Supply chain challenges, especially the replenishment problem involving optimized and non-optimized approaches, inventory policies (r, Q) and (s, S) are discussed. The (r, Q) inventory policy places an order of Q quantities when the inventory level reaches r. On the other hand, the (s, S) policy involves periodic review of inventory: if inventory is found below level s, it is brought back to level S by placing an order. The paper also discusses the concept of Demand forecasting and techniques such as Exponential Smoothing, rolling forecast using Winterâ€™s method (optimized using Excel solver) and ARIMA (in R). Demand on a sample dataset is forecasted and the results are used to calculate the safety stock level, reorder point and quantity for a given Lead time. Finally, a multiperiod linear programming model is defined to optimize material flows and inventory levels in order to reduce out of stock and excess inventory along with reduced costs. The model proposed allow supply chain planning through simultaneous optimization of safety stock levels in tandem with material flows.
